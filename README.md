# Deep-Learning-for-Robot-Perception

The course began with core machine learning concepts like KNN and linear models, and progressed through neural networks, CNNs, and vision transformers applied to classification, detection, segmentation, and pose estimation tasks.
We implemented each model from scratch using PyTorch, gaining practical insight into network design, training strategies, and evaluation.
The final project involved reproducing and extending a published deep learning paper, demonstrating research-level understanding and innovation in robotic perception.
